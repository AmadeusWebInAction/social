__page	The New Online Home of Imran.	#dreams #reality #helpless #saving-humankind
the-technologist	In [the past](https://imran.yieldmore.org/career-past/), I was a damn good programmer / solution architect, always leading teams, solving developer infrastructure requirements and generally improving the skill density of the teams I led and supported.	#tech-lead #coding
the-journey	Creative on one side and passionate about the human conditions and how tech could facilitate a large number of [progressive communities](%amadeus-url%), today, I can boast a [skill at writing](https://yieldmore.org/) and a way to ideate and collaborate.	#creativity #people-connect
bibliography	Since late 2016 (when I had a friend to inspire me) I have been penning poems at > 50 per year. They will be reorganized by theme shortly.	#writing #poems
healing-through-words	A little more confident now, I will shortly launch a "heal through words" programme and look to find a few kindred souls who will help build on it and serve in their circles.	#co-healing #self-driven #compassion
what-is-amadeusweb	Originally a vehicle for yieldmore articles and publications, my ability to craft file based windows and web applications has been around since 2000. Today it's like fire in the hands of those communities who want a failsafe way to outline its content / breakdown and member interactions where websites are almost like physical commmunities. The roadmap is long and extensive. Come, be dazzled.	#tech #own-and-control-your-content
